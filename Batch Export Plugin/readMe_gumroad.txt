Thank you for using my script, I hope it will help you!
All my scripts are not encoded so you can look into the code and hopefully learn python yourself.
Please do not distribute the code to your friends, send them a link to my Gumroad site to support me!

Please rate my script on the download page, you did get a link via email.

If you have any comments or critique dont hesitate to contact me.
